Add a new code chunk in which you make a new little ggplot2 2D hex density plot using the built-in storms dataset as follows:
```{r}
ggplot(data=storms, aes(x=pressure, y=wind))+
  geom_hex() +
<<<<<<< HEAD
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "magenta") + 
  theme_bw()
=======
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "magenta")+
  theme_minimal()
